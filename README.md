## *Swarm-Rescue* competition details

The competition seeks to explore a real life problem: using autonomous drone swarms to carry rescue missions in high risk environments.

The objective of the mission is to map an unknown, potentially hostile area, detect targets (injured or healthy people), and guide them out of the area. In the simulation, we must control a fleet of 10 drones. Each drone is equipped with communication functions and sensors.

Challenges include: limited range communication, no-GPS zones, no-comms zones, kill-zones and collision damage.
